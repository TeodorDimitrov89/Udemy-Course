Configuring Page Transitions
Section 2, Lecture 30

Besides the page you want to go to and data you want to pass along, you can pass a third argument to push() (and a first argument to pop()): Navigation Options

These options allow you to configure the page transition. You do set your own configuration by passing a JS object where you may set the following properties:

    animate (boolean): Whether or not the transition should animate.
    animation (string): What kind of animation should be used.
    direction (string): The conceptual direction the user is navigating. For example, is the user navigating forward, or back?
    duration (number): The length in milliseconds the animation should take.
    easing (string): The easing for the animation.
    
    Example:
          this.navCtrl.push(NewPage, {}, {
          direction: 'back', // default for push is 'forward'
          duration: 2000, // 2 seconds
          easing: 'ease-out'
      });
